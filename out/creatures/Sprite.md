## Attacks

***Longsword.*** +2 (Stab 0 DEX +2), reach 5ft_1.5m_1sq, one target. Hit: 1 slashing damage.

***Shortbow.*** +4 (Shoot 2 DEX +2), range 40/160ft_48m_32sq, one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. If its saving throw result is 5 or lower, the poisoned target falls unconscious for the same duration, or until it takes damage or another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

***Heart Sight.*** The sprite touches a creature and magically knows the creature's current emotional state. If the target fails a DC 10 Charisma saving throw, the sprite also knows the creature's alignment. Celestials, fiends, and undead automatically fail the saving throw.

***Invisibility.*** The sprite magically turns invisible until it attacks or casts a spell, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the sprite wears or carries is invisible with it.
