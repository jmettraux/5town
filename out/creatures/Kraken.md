## Attacks

***Multiattack.*** The kraken makes three tentacle attacks, each of which it can replace with one use of Fling.

***Bite.*** +9 (Stab 7 STR +2), reach 5ft_1.5m_1sq, one target. Hit: 3d8+2 piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature grappled by the kraken, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and it takes 42 (12d6) acid damage at the start of each of the kraken's turns.

***Tentacle.*** +9 (Stab 7 STR +2), reach 30ft_9m_6sq_t, one target. Hit: 3d6+2 bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The kraken has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

***Fling.*** One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by the kraken is thrown up to 60ft_18m_12sq_tt in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10ft_3m_2sq it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.

***Lightning Storm.*** The kraken magically creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within 120ft_36m_24sq_FFF of it. A target must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
