## Attacks

***Multiattack*** The worm makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its stinger.

***Bite*** +7 (Stab 5 STR +2), reach 10ft\_3m\_2sq, one target. Hit: 3d8+2 piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the worm. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the worm, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the worm's turns.

***Tail Stinger*** +7 (Stab 5 STR +2), reach 10ft\_3m\_2sq, one creature. Hit: 3d6+2 piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
