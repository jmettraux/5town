## Attacks

***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** +8 (Stab 6 STR +2), reach 10ft\_3m\_2sq, one target. Hit: 2d10+2 piercing damage.

***Claw.*** +8 (Stab 6 STR +2), reach 5ft\_1.5m\_1sq, one target. Hit: 2d6+2 slashing damage.

***Tail.*** +8 (Stab 6 STR +2), reach 15ft\_4.5m\_3sq, one target. Hit: 2d8+2 bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120ft\_36m\_24sq\_FFF of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

***Fire Breath..*** The dragon exhales fire in a 60ft\_18m\_12sq\_tt cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Weakening Breath..*** The dragon exhales gas in a 60ft\_18m\_12sq\_tt cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or have disadvantage on Strength-based attack rolls, Strength checks, and Strength saving throws for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Change Shape.*** The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon's choice).
