## Attacks

***Multiattack*** The behir makes two attacks: one with its bite and one to constrict.

***Bite*** +6 (Stab 4 STR +2), reach 10ft\_3m\_2sq, one target. Hit: 3d10+2 piercing damage.

***Constrict*** +6 (Stab 4 STR +2), reach 5ft\_1.5m\_1sq, one Large or smaller creature. Hit: 2d10+2 bludgeoning damage plus 17 (2d10+6) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 16) if the behir isn't already constricting a creature, and the target is restrained until this grapple ends.

***Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6)*** The behir exhales a line of lightning that is 20ft\_6m\_4sq\_t-2 long and 5ft\_1.5m\_1sq wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Swallow*** The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behir's turns. A behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time.
