## Attacks

***Claws.*** +4 (Stab 2 STR +2), reach 5ft\_1.5m\_1sq, one target. Hit: 2d8+2 slashing damage.

***Illusory Appearance.*** The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

***Invisible Passage.*** The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.
