## Attacks

***Tentacles.*** +3 (Stab 2 DEX +1), reach 5ft_1.5m_1sq, one target. Hit: 1 bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 10). Until this grapple ends, the octopus can't use its tentacles on another target.

***Ink Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** A 5ft_1.5m_1sq radius cloud of ink extends all around the octopus if it is underwater. The area is heavily obscured for 1 minute, although a significant current can disperse the ink. After releasing the ink, the octopus can use the Dash action as a bonus action.
