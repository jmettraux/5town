### Attacks

***Multiattack*** The djinni makes three scimitar attacks.

***Scimitar*** +6 (Stab 4 STR +2) Shock 1+2/AC13, reach 5ft\_1.5m\_1sq, one target. Hit: 2d6+2 slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning or thunder damage (djinni's choice).

***Create Whirlwind*** A 5ft\_1.5m\_1sq radius, 30ft\_9m\_6sq\_t tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms on a point the djinni can see within 120ft\_36m\_24sq\_FFF of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60ft\_18m\_12sq\_tt as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.
