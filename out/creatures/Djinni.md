## Attacks

***Multiattack.*** The djinni makes three scimitar attacks.

***Scimitar.*** +6 (Stab 4 STR +2), reach 5ft_1.5m_1sq, one target. Hit: 2d6+2 slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning or thunder damage (djinni's choice).

***Create Whirlwind.*** A 5ft_1.5m_1sq radius, 30ft_9m_6sq tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms on a point the djinni can see within 120ft_36m_24sq of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60ft_18m_12sq as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.
