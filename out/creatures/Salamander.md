***Spear.*** +6 (Shoot 5 DEX +1), range 20ft\_6m\_4sq\_t-2/60ft\_18m\_12sq\_tt, one target. Hit: 2d6+1 piercing damage, or 13 (2d8+4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.

***Tail.*** +5 (Stab 3 STR +2), reach 10ft\_3m\_2sq, one target. Hit: 2d6+2 bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14).
