***Spear.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:+5 (Shoot 3 STR +2), reach 5 ft. or range 20 ft./60 ft., one target. Hit: 2d6+2 piercing damage, or 13 (2d8+4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.

***Tail.*** +5 (Stab 3 STR +2), reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 2d6+2 bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14).
