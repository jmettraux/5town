### Attacks

***Multiattack*** The wight makes two longsword attacks or two longbow attacks. It can use its Life Drain in place of one longsword attack.

***Life Drain*** +3 (Stab 2 DEX +1), reach 5ft\_1.5m\_1sq, one creature. Hit: 1d6+1 necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
