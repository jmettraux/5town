## Attacks

***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** +8 (Stab 6 STR +2), reach 15ft_4.5m_3sq, one target. Hit: 2d10+2 piercing damage.

***Claw.*** +8 (Stab 6 STR +2), reach 10ft_3m_2sq, one target. Hit: 2d6+2 slashing damage.

***Tail.*** +8 (Stab 6 STR +2), reach 20ft_6m_4sq, one target. Hit: 2d8+2 bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120ft_36m_24sq of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons:

***Fire Breath..*** The dragon exhales fire in an 90ft_27m_18sq line that is 10ft_3m_2sq wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Sleep Breath..*** The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 90ft_27m_18sq cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.

***Change Shape.*** The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon's choice).
