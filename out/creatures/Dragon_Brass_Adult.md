## Attacks

***Multiattack*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite*** +7 (Stab 5 STR +2), reach 10ft\_3m\_2sq, one target. Hit: 2d10+2 piercing damage.

***Claw*** +7 (Stab 5 STR +2), reach 5ft\_1.5m\_1sq, one target. Hit: 2d6+2 slashing damage.

***Tail*** +7 (Stab 5 STR +2), reach 15ft\_4.5m\_3sq, one target. Hit: 2d8+2 bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120ft\_36m\_24sq\_FFF of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6)*** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

***Fire Breath*** The dragon exhales fire in an 60ft\_18m\_12sq\_tt line that is 5ft\_1.5m\_1sq wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (13d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Sleep Breath*** The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 60ft\_18m\_12sq\_tt cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.
