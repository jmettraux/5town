## Attacks

***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** +8 (Stab 6 STR +2), reach 15ft_4.5m_3sq, one target. Hit: 2d10+2 piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) cold damage.

***Claw.*** +8 (Stab 6 STR +2), reach 10ft_3m_2sq, one target. Hit: 2d6+2 slashing damage.

***Tail.*** +8 (Stab 6 STR +2), reach 20ft_6m_4sq_t-2, one target. Hit: 2d8+2 bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120ft_36m_24sq_FFF of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 90ft_27m_18sq_ttt cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 72 (16d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
