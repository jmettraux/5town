***Petrifying Breath (Recharge 5-6)*** The gorgon exhales petrifying gas in a 30ft\_9m\_6sq\_t cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends on the target. On a failure, the target is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.
