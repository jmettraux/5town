## Attacks

***Multiattack.*** The golem makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** +6 (Stab 4 STR +2), reach 5ft\_1.5m\_1sq, one target. Hit: 3d8+2 bludgeoning damage.

***Slow (Recharge 5-6).*** The golem targets one or more creatures it can see within 10ft\_3m\_2sq of it. Each target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic. On a failed save, a target can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
