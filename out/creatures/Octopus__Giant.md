## Attacks

***Tentacles*** +3 (Stab 2 STR +1), reach 15ft\_4.5m\_3sq, one target. Hit: 2d6+1 bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the octopus can't use its tentacles on another target.

***Ink Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)*** A 20ft\_6m\_4sq\_t-2 radius cloud of ink extends all around the octopus if it is underwater. The area is heavily obscured for 1 minute, although a significant current can disperse the ink. After releasing the ink, the octopus can use the Dash action as a bonus action.
