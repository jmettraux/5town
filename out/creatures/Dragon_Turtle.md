## Attacks

***Multiattack.*** The dragon turtle makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws. It can make one tail attack in place of its two claw attacks.

***Bite.*** +8 (Stab 6 STR +2), reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 3d12+2 piercing damage.

***Claw.*** +8 (Stab 6 STR +2), reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 2d8+2 slashing damage.

***Tail.*** +8 (Stab 6 STR +2), reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 3d12+2 bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the dragon turtle and knocked prone.

***Steam Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon turtle exhales scalding steam in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (15d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage.
