### Attacks

***Multiattack*** The dragon turtle makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws. It can make one tail attack in place of its two claw attacks.

***Bite*** +8 (Stab 6 STR +2), reach 15ft\_4.5m\_3sq, one target. Hit: 3d12+2 piercing damage.

***Claw*** +8 (Stab 6 STR +2) Shock 2+2/AC13, reach 10ft\_3m\_2sq, one target. Hit: 2d8+2 slashing damage.

***Tail*** +8 (Stab 6 STR +2), reach 15ft\_4.5m\_3sq, one target. Hit: 3d12+2 bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10ft\_3m\_2sq away from the dragon turtle and knocked prone.

***Steam Breath (Recharge 5-6)*** The dragon turtle exhales scalding steam in a 60ft\_18m\_12sq\_tt cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (15d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage.
