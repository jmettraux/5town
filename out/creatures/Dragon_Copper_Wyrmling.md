***Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

***Acid Breath..*** The dragon exhales acid in an 20ft_6m_4sq_t-2 line that is 5ft_1.5m_1sq wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Slowing Breath..*** The dragon exhales gas in a 15ft_4.5m_3sq cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw.
