***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)*** For 1 minute, the knight can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30ft\_9m\_6sq\_t of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the knight. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the knight is incapacitated.
