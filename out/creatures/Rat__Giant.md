***Bite*** +3 (Stab 2 DEX +1), reach 5ft\_1.5m\_1sq, one target. Hit: 1d4+1 piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease. Until the disease is cured, the target can't regain hit points except by magical means, and the target's hit point maximum decreases by 3 (1d6) every 24 hours. If the target's hit point maximum drops to 0 as a result of this disease, the target dies.
