## Attacks

***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** +7 (Stab 5 STR +2), reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 2d10+2 piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.

***Claw.*** +7 (Stab 5 STR +2), reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2d6+2 slashing damage.

***Tail.*** +7 (Stab 5 STR +2), reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 2d8+2 bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales poisonous gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
