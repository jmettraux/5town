## Attacks

***Multiattack.*** The crocodile makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.

***Bite.*** +5 (Stab 3 STR +2), reach 5ft\_1.5m\_1sq, one target. Hit: 3d10+2 piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the crocodile can't bite another target.

***Tail.*** +5 (Stab 3 STR +2), reach 10ft\_3m\_2sq, one target not grappled by the crocodile. Hit: 2d8+2 bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
