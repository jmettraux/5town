### Attacks

***Bite*** +3 (Stab 2 DEX +1), reach 5ft\_1.5m\_1sq, one creature. Hit: 1d8+1 piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.

***Web (Recharge 5-6)*** +3 (Shoot 2 DEX +1), range 30ft\_9m\_6sq\_t / 60ft\_18m\_12sq\_tt, one creature. Hit: The target is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 12 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).

### Other

To snare its prey, a **giant spider** spins elaborate webs or shoots sticky strands of webbing from its abdomen. Giant spiders are most commonly found underground, making their lairs on ceilings or in dark, web-filled crevices. Such lairs are often festooned with web cocoons holding past victims.
